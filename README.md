# traffic_forcasting
This is a template to help beginners work on the traffic forcasting program.
I will add more lines to the code.
Here are the plans:
1. Parse the day and page. (done:07/08/2017)
2. Split train, test and hold out, and build a random forest model.
3. Build a function for the metric. (done:07/08/2017)
4. Build a function for submission.
5. Add google trend as feature.
6. Add simple time-series features.
7. Build more features using clustering.
